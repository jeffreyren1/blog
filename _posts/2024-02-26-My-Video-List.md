1. FFmpeg actually has too many functions. The process of learning FFmpeg is not a tedious process of writing command lines to the screen, but rather helps you understand the essence of multimedia files
2. In actual use, it is not directly inputting commands, but rather writing commonly used commands into scripts in advance
3. FFmpeg is not suitable as a main editing software. Professional editing software can provide many functions that it does not have
4. In addition to FFmpeg, there are other tools available for processing multimedia files, such as Audacity for processing audio files and PicPick for processing images
