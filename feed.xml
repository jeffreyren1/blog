<p><strong>PRIVACY</strong> and <strong>CONVENIENCE</strong> are evil twins, and there is no absolute privacy in the world. Relative balance can create a beautiful scenery. Excessive balance will destroy this beauty. If you choose to respect your privacy rights, please note that this will to some extent infringe on the rights of the corresponding service provider and may result in your service provider exercising the right to refuse to provide some or all services. Therefore, please think twice before taking action. For the convenience of decision-making, this article will briefly attach examples at the beginning of each chapter that are known to cause such situations. Of course, the improvement of privacy level will also come at the cost of sacrificing some convenience. You need to weigh the pros and cons on your own and make decisions that are deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>Here are some methods to protect your privacy as much as possible:</p>

<h2 id="1-app-ops">1. App Ops</h2>

<p>The reason why cancer software causes cancer is largely due to the combination of the above two factors. One of its manifestations is the excessive demand for permissions.</p>

<p>AppOps can provide better and more detailed permission management functions than native Android systems.You can use it on the root phone, or activate Shizuku using ADB and grant AppOps device administrator privileges to achieve the same goal.</p>

<h2 id="2-storage-redirect">2. Storage Redirect</h2>

<p>Due to the limitations of lower version Android permission design, any application that has obtained full storage permission can read almost all content in the phone. At the same time, they can freely write various files to achieve various unexpected goals. This is often not what we want. What needs to be read can be read, and what doesn&#8217;t need to be read should not be moved, nor can it be moved. This may be what we imagine.</p>

<p>You can use this software to achieve: the application will only place files in its own space; The application can only read its own files, as well as files that are pre-set to be readable.</p>

<h2 id="3-afwall">3. AFWall+</h2>

<p>AFWall+is an open-source &#8220;firewall&#8221; that can control the behavior of application networking. Root permission is required to set interception rules. It can control the communication between an application and the Internet or other local applications.</p>

<h2 id="4-hidemyapplist">4. HideMyApplist</h2>

<p>HideMyApplist is a list of apps that can be hidden from the launcher.Some software exploit various system vulnerabilities in an attempt to obtain a list of applications installed on the phone, in order to generate a user profile. Therefore, restricting some applications from accessing the application list has become one of the important methods to balance privacy and convenience.</p>

<h2 id="5-ice-box">5. Ice Box</h2>

<p>Ice Box is a utility that can freeze applications. It can be used to prevent applications from consuming resources and to prevent applications from accessing the Internet.</p>

<p>You can set shortcuts, automatic freeze conditions, lock screen delay, exception situations, and other functions, which are very convenient to use.</p>

<h2 id="6-my-android-tools">6. My Android Tools</h2>

<p>Android has four main services: services, broadcast receivers, and event and content providers. In short, as the four core components of Android applications, the &#8220;Four Kings&#8221; are the cornerstone for various applications to implement various logic. However, not all components are necessary for daily use of corresponding applications. Therefore, privacy protection can be achieved by using My Android Tools to selectively disabling certain components to prevent the application from performing specific operations.</p>

<h2 id="7-summary">7. Summary</h2>

<p>The above methods can help you protect your privacy from a system perspective. Of course, there is much more we can do!</p>]]></content><author><name>Jeffrey</name></author><category term="misc" /><category term="misc" /><category term="android" /><category term="privacy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Video List</title><link href="https://jeffreyren1.github.io//jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/misc/2024/02/24/My-Video-List.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Video List" /><published>2024-02-24T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2025-07-03T19:01:53+08:00</updated><id>https://jeffreyren1.github.io//jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/misc/2024/02/24/My-Video-List</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeffreyren1.github.io//jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/misc/2024/02/24/My-Video-List.html"><![CDATA[<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

  <li>FFmpeg actually has too many functions. The process of learning FFmpeg is not a tedious process of writing command lines to the screen, but rather helps you understand the essence of multimedia files</li>
  <li>In actual use, it is not directly inputting commands, but rather writing commonly used commands into scripts in advance</li>
  <li>FFmpeg is not suitable as a main editing software. Professional editing software can provide many functions that it does not have</li>
  <li>In addition to FFmpeg, there are other tools available for processing multimedia files, such as Audacity for processing audio files and PicPick for processing images</li>

USE ## Introduction -->

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Summer Palace, also known as Yiheyuan in Chinese, is a majestic royal garden nestled in the northwest outskirts of Beijing. Recognized as one of China&#8217;s most cherished and extensive imperial parks, it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998.</p>

<p>Constructed primarily during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), the Summer Palace served as a luxurious retreat for emperors seeking respite from the scorching summer heat of the Forbidden City. The design harmoniously combines natural landscapes with artificial structures, reflecting traditional Chinese gardening aesthetics and architectural brilliance.</p>

<p>Spanning over 290 hectares, the park features breathtaking scenic spots such as Kunming Lake and Longevity Hill. The iconic Seventeen-Arch Bridge elegantly traverses the lake, while the magnificent Hall of Dispelling Clouds perches atop the hill, offering panoramic views. The Long Corridor, adorned with thousands of intricate paintings, meanders along the water&#8217;s edge, providing visitors with a vivid display of classical art.</p>

<p>The Summer Palace also boasts historical buildings like the Marble Boat, which symbolizes the stability of the Qing dynasty despite turbulent times, and the Tower of Buddhist Incense, a towering pagoda that stands as a testament to religious influence on imperial life.</p>

<p>Today, the Summer Palace continues to attract millions of tourists every year who come to admire its rich history, exquisite architecture, and serene beauty. It not only serves as a living museum but also as a tranquil oasis within the bustling metropolis of Beijing, where one can experience the grandeur of China&#8217;s imperial past and appreciate the delicate balance between human creativity and nature&#8217;s serenity.</p>

<!-- [Markdown] [label1] 中间需要加一个空格 -->

<p>You can write regular <a href="https://markdowntutorial.com/">markdown</a> here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown- it&#8217;ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.</p>

<h2 id="an-exhibit-of-markdown">An exhibit of Markdown</h2>

<p><em>Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn&#8217;t automatically save itself.</em></p>

<h2 id="basic-formatting">Basic formatting</h2>

<p>Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.</p>

<p>Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> is supported. This <em>can be <strong>nested</strong> like</em> so.</p>

<h3 id="emoji">Emoji</h3>

<p>You can use emoji here： 😄
<!-- 直接使用😄， 不要使用:smile:，免得渲染不出来--></p>

<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>

<p>There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You&#8217;ve probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.</p>

<h3 id="headings-can-contain-formatting-even-contain-inline-code">Headings <em>can</em> contain <strong>formatting</strong>, even contain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code</code></h3>

<p>Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you&#8217;re smallest heading isn&#8217;t too small, and you&#8217;re largest heading isn&#8217;t too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.</p>

<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>

<p>URLs can be made in a handful of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A named link to <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a>. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+L</code>.</li>
  <li>Another named link to <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a></li>
  <li>Sometimes you just want a URL like <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">https://www.markitdown.net/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="images">Images</h2>

<p>How about a yummy crepe?</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg" alt="Crepe" />{.:block_center}</p>

<p>It can also be centered!</p>
<div align="right">

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code</code> to add code into other things.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a code chunk:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span> <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Hello, World!<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Ruby">def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')  #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
</code></pre>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
